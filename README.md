This is a decentralized loyalty program that allows customers to earn ETH when they purchase from partners. 

# About

The purpose of this project is to develop a platform where customers can earn ETH when they purchase from partners. When making a purchase the partner will reward the customer with ETH based on the total value that the customer spent. The custmer can then sawp the ETH for DAI or other ERC20 tokens allowing customers to be in total control of how they move and preserve their value.

The customers that have made a purchase from any of the partners within the last 7 days will be eligible for a weekly lottery. The lottery winner gets a percentage of the total pool amount for the partner.


# Example workflows
1. As a customer I want to earn ETH based on my purchases with partners so that I can be financially rewarded for my loyalty.
2. As a customer I want to swap ETH for DAI so that I can use it to fit my needs when the time comes.
3. As a customer I want to take part in weekly lottery so that I can get more value for shopping at partner stores or websites.
4. As a partner I want to sponsor a weekly lottery amount so that I can make customers come to my store or website.
5. As a customer I want to see how and where I earned my ETH so that I am able to make better decisions of where I shop in future.
