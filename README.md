This is a decentralized loyalty program that allows customers to earn ETH when they purchase from partners. 

# About

The purpose of this project is to develop a platform where customers can earn ETH when they purchase from partners. When making a purchase the partner will reward the customer with ETH based on the total value that the customer spent. The custmer can then sawp the ETH for DAI or other ERC20 tokens allowing customers to be in total control of how they move and preserve their value.

The customers that have made a purchase from any of the partners within the last 7 days will be eligible for a weekly NFT drop/voucher (lottery). This NFT could be;
* a voucher from one of the partners that allows the winner to receive a specified package. 
* an NFT from our collaborating artists.



# Example workflows
1. As a customer I want to earn tokens based on my purchases with partners so that I can be financially rewarded for my loyalty.
2. As a customer I want to swap the loyalty token for DAI so that I can use it to fit my needs when the time comes.
3. As a customer I want to take part in the weekly NFT/Voucher lottery so that I can get more value for shopping at partner stores or websites.
4. As a partner I want to sponsor weekly NFT prizes that can be won as part of the lottery so that I can make customers come to my store or website to redeem the prize.
5. As an artist I want to sponsor artistic NFT drops that can be won as part of the lottery so that I can improve my profile and engagement.
6. As a customer I want to see how and where I earned my tokens so that I am able to make better decisions of where I shop in future. 
7. As a customer I want to see all the NFTâ€™s I have earned as part of the weekly lottery so that I am able to see the benefits of being a loyal customer.
